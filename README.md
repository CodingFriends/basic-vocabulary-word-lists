All beginnings are difficult. And this is also true for learning languages. Especially when getting started with a language, where there aren't many resources, it is challenging to find one's way.

Sure, there are many resources when you want to learn German or French. But what about languages with fewer speakers, such as Slovak or Finnish? Or if your base language is not English?

When we started to work on [Wokabulary](https://wokabulary.com), an app that lets you practice and collect your individual foreign language words, we did not expect our users to learn such a variety of languages! Many of our users are learning small or even endangered languages. This motivated us to start creating cross-language basic word lists. 

## Essential words and phrases for all situations

The word lists cover the most basic and useful words and essential phrases. Words that help you find your way, understand the menu in the restaurant, to run errands and to describe your surroundings. Altogether, over 200 words for each language!

The topics are:
* Basic words
* Essential sentences
* Directions
* Weather, city and nature
* Food
* Transport
* Technology
* Time
* Health
* Personal information
* Essential words
* Essential adjectives
* Colors
* Numbers

## Want to make your language available?
